Actually, I hate to suggest it because I don't want it to get overrun with tourists. But it seems more than a little selfish to not share. :grin:

Here a few of my personal photos. 
1. This one is from a farm. [Farm](https://photos.app.goo.gl/PoJ2ync9CdKPKDYG8)
2. This is the view from a nursing home/church/B&B in Celje. This is where I want to live if I ever have to go in a nursing home. [View from nursing home](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4jCzsRtXaGbpMWEx6)
3. Everyone knows about Lake Bled, but Bohinj is nothing to sneeze at. [Bled's competition](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hYFXzmXQa3B1jEKPA)
