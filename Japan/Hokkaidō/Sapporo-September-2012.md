# [Sapporo, September 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapporo)

## Transport

* The train from Sapporo to Tokyo (or the other way around) is very expensive, and very slow. There are basically two option:
    * Two trains, a sleeper train from Sapporo to Aomori at the northern tip of Honshu, then a Shinkansen south to Tokyo. I didn't take this option, but I think the total travel time was > 10 hours. 
    * A sleeper all the way. This goes direct from Sapporo Station to Ueno in Tokyo. There are a few different trains and different cabin options in each. I went with the cheapest option on the train and it was still a little more expensive than a flight *and* a hotel. 
      It also took a very long time. It was scheduled for 15 hours or so, and took about 17 (there was basically a blizzard in Hokkaido at the time which may have contributed). You get on in the evening, and arrive late morning the next day.

* Sapporo Soup Curry is fantastic and cheap (And unlike other stuff I've had in Japan). I went to Hiri Hiri, there are a few of them around town. Was quite tasty.
